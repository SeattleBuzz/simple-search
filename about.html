  				<li><p>We are a simple <strong>search service</strong> that searches for bars and clubs in and around Seattle based on a search query.</p></li>
  				<li><p>Our inspiration behind this project birthed from a mutual understanding that being in college is stressful and difficult with all the work that has to be done, and we all shared a common desire to unwind and relax the best we know how, by hitting up the most popular clubs and bars in the city. However, not everyone knew where the best place to party was. And thus, an idea was born.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class = "sub">Marketing plan</h2>
			<hr/>

			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  				<li><p>Utilizing personas would help us with the process of developing our search service. One of the personas we created was Cristine, a 22 year old junior at the UW. With an 18 credit schedule on top of a part time job, Cristine works through the week living for Friday nights, weekends, as well as those random, blissful, obligation-free-evenings. When she does have times like those, she only has one objective on her mind, finding a bar that has happy hour between 7pm and 11pm. But it is hard to find a bar that has those specific happy hour times, and if she was with her friends, decision making slows down further. That’s where we come in.  Instead of surfing the net, clicking through countless links, we provide a list of bars and their links that directs her to the most relevant information in the least amount of time needed.</p></li>
  				
  				<li><p>Our goals for the coming three months consists of reaching 200 ”likes” on facebook, 500 followers in twitter and more importantly a increase ranking on google. </p></li>

  				<li><p>An important element to any sound marketing plan is to recognize the competition. With that in mind, we identified our top three, Google, Yelp and Club Zone.  Our plan to in order make ourselves a viable competitor was to focus on a simple front end design which will be discussed later in this video. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<hr/>
			<h2 class = "sub">Technical plan</h2>
			<hr/>

			<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  				<li><p><strong>Front-end Technology</strong>:  we incorporated the use of meta tag keywords, which included drinks near me, seattle clubs, seattle events, bar search engine as well as club search engine. These keywords are visible to search engine crawlers such as solr, or those employed by Google and Bing. This allows other services to know that our website is about finding clubs and bars in seattle.</p></li>
  				
  				<li><p><strong>Back-end Technology</strong>: we implemented spell check, which gives suggestions in case of typo, in order to receive more relevant results.2.	We also used ExtendedDisMax query parser for boosting in order to improve relevance by 20%. Along the web site building process, we took a stab at hit highlighting, but our attempt was interrupted as we failed to take into account how much time we needed in order to figure out how to implement this on the front end.</p></li>
